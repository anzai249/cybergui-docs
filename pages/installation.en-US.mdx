# Installation

The following describes how to install the environment.

## Environment Configuration

<Steps>

### Download the Source Code

Please go to the [Release Page](https://github.com/anzai249/CyberGui/releases) to get the latest version and unzip it.

(Not Recommend) If you want to use the version under development you can clone the repository.

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/anzai249/CyberGui.git
```

### Database

Highly recommend `MySQL >= 5.7`, and the development environment uses `8.0` version, lower version may means unstability.

### Compile and Deploy

Run this at the source code directory:

```shell copy
npm install
```

Compile and minify for production:

```shell copy
npm run build
```

And then you can check `./dist/` to discover the files you compiled.

### Database Settings

Please use `./service/cybergui.sql` to create your database and database name you will see it below.

Create a `secret.json` at `./service/`, here is the content:

```json filename="secret.json" copy
{
  "mysql": {
    "dev": {
      "username": "root",
      "password": "root",
      "name": "cybergui",
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    "prod": {
      "username": "root",
      "password": "root",
      "name": "cybergui",
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  },
  "password": "admin"
}
```

Attention, `dev` contains the information of development environment, `prod`contains the information of production environment, `name` is your database name, `host` is your database host, default port `3306`. 

`username` and `password`, these two are your database username and password.

`password` outside is your admin password in order to answer questions and delete questions or so.

### Frontend Configuration

Please edit `settings.json` at `./src/`:

```json filename="secret.json" copy
{
    "images": {
        "avatar": "",
        "logo_big": "",
        "logo_small": ""
    },
    "others": {
        "colors": [
            "#c3cfe2"
        ],
        "defaultLanguage": "zhcn"
    },
    "theme": {
        "primaryColor": "#8a2be2",
        "primaryColorHover": "#8a2be2"
    }
}
```
#### `images`

`avatar` is the avatar of the host of the website, `logo_big` is the desktop logo of the website (top left), `logo_small` is the mobile logo of the website.
